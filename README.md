# Max-PlusTCPModel


This is discrete event simulator that verifies the corectness of the the [TCP tropical max-plus model](https://github.com/0xJepsen/Max-PlusTCPModel/blob/master/Papers/Refrences/TCPMaxPlus.pdf). It should be noted that this model has been abstracted into it's relative classes so that it can scale for a variety of network topologies and parameters. 

## Simulator Architecture

The model files are within the `Model` Directory of which has several compenents to be described here in more detail.
