# Max-PlusTCPModel


This is discrete event simulator that verifies the corectness of the the [TCP tropical max-plus model](https://github.com/0xJepsen/Max-PlusTCPModel/blob/master/Papers/Refrences/TCPMaxPlus.pdf). It should be noted that this model has been abstracted into it's relative classes so that it can scale for a variety of network topologies and parameters. 

## Simulator Architecture

The model files are within the `Model` Directory of which has several compenents to be described here in more detail.

## Results

A summary of the results and theoretical improvements to the model can be found [here](https://github.com/0xJepsen/Max-PlusTCPModel/blob/master/Modeling_TCP_Congestion_with_Tropical_Algebra.pdf). [Dr. Partridge](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=f-E5nFEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) is working with more students expand on the work that may result in a final paper on how to break TCP with this work. I will be moving on to DeFi Research with [Dr. Altarawneh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CfjaUOsAAAAJ&hl=en), but will be availible to help students use this work.
